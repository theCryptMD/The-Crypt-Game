It reduces stress on joints and muscles, allowing for optimal performance and reducing the likelihood of overuse injuries.,\nGame Use: Players can earn points for completing movement assessments, participating in corrective exercises, and demonstrating improved movement patterns during daily activities and workouts.,\nUnit of Measure: Score out of 100,\nHow to Measure: 1. Movement Assessment:  Complete a comprehensive movement assessment with a qualified physical therapist, including assessments of: \\\\n - Range of Motion: Evaluate joint flexibility and mobility. \\\\n - Strength & Stability: Test muscle strength and core stability. \\\\n - Balance & Coordination: Assess dynamic balance and coordination. \\\\n - Posture Analysis:  Observe standing and sitting posture. \\\\n - Functional Movement Patterns: Assess basic movement patterns like squatting, lunging, and reaching. 2. Corrective Exercise Program:  Based on the assessment results,  participate in a personalised corrective exercise program designed to address movement limitations and improve overall efficiency. 3. Self-Monitoring:  Record your progress in a journal or app, noting any improvements in movement patterns, decreased pain or discomfort, and increased ease of movement during activities. 4. Score Calculation: The score will be calculated based on the results of the movement assessment, the consistency of your participation in the corrective exercise program, and your self-reported progress.,\nNormal Values: N/A - This is a subjective measure.,\nReferences: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031590/,\nValidated Measure: Yes,\nTarget Age Group: Career Navigators (20-29 years),\nTarget Level: 4 Virtuoso\nResult Type: Quantitative,\nResult Type Subtype: Continuous,\nAdditional Notes: This metric is challenging to track due to the need for a professional assessment and ongoing participation in a corrective exercise program. However, it can be gamified by allowing players to earn points for completing assessments, exercises, and achieving specific movement goals. Regular feedback from the physical therapist will be essential to guide progress and ensure effective injury prevention.\n\n\nArticle: Profession: Physical Therapist\nFocus Area: Injury Prevention\nCategory: Body\nSubcategory: Fitness\nLevel: 4 Virtuoso\nAge Group: Career Navigators (20-29 years)\n\nThe title of above article can be: Metric Name: Functional Movement Quality Rating,\nDescription: This metric assesses the quality of your fundamental movement patterns, providing insights into potential injury risks and areas for improvement.,\nObjectives: To help users understand their movement quality, identify imbalances or limitations, and make informed decisions about exercise and daily activities to prevent injuries.,\nCategory: Body,\nSubcategory: Fitness,\nSignificance: Movement quality is a strong predictor of injury risk. Addressing movement deficiencies can significantly reduce the likelihood of injuries and enhance overall physical performance.,\nGame Use: Players can earn points for completing movement assessments, engaging in corrective exercises, and demonstrating improvements in movement quality through video submissions or in-person evaluations.,\nUnit of Measure: Qualitative rating scale (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor),\nHow to Measure: 1. Movement Screen: Complete a standardised movement screen (e.g., Functional Movement Screen) with a qualified physical therapist. This screen will assess foundational movements like squatting, lunging, pushing, pulling, and rotating. 2. Qualitative Evaluation: The physical therapist will evaluate each movement pattern based on established criteria, such as range of motion, control, stability, and alignment. 3. Rating Assignment:  The physical therapist will assign an overall rating (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) based on the combined assessment of all movement patterns. This rating reflects your current movement quality.,\nNormal Values: N/A - Movement quality is highly individual and varies based on factors like age, activity level, and injury history.,\nReferences: Functional Movement Systems: Screening, Assessment, Corrective Strategies by Gray Cook,\nValidated Measure: Yes,\nTarget Age Group: Career Navigators (20-29 years),\nTarget Level: 4 Virtuoso\nResult Type: Qualitative,\nResult Type Subtype: Categorical (Ordinal)\nAdditional Notes: This metric offers a comprehensive assessment of movement efficiency, providing valuable insights into potential injury risks and areas for improvement.   While it requires professional guidance and ongoing effort, it can be effectively gamified by awarding points for completing assessments, adhering to prescribed exercises, and demonstrating progress toward movement goals. Regular feedback from a physical therapist is essential to interpret results, tailor interventions, and ensure continued progress towards improved movement patterns and reduced injury risk.\n\n\nArticle: Profession: Health Coach\nFocus Area: Lifestyle Consistency\nCategory: Body\nSubcategory: Health Monitoring\nLevel: 2 Savvy\nAge Group: Lifespan Hacks (All Age Groups)\n\n\nThe title of above article can be: Metric Name: Healthy Habit Streak,\nDescription: This metric tracks the longest consecutive period (in days) during which a user has successfully completed a predefined set of healthy habits.,\nObjectives: To help users build and maintain healthy routines, promote consistent behaviour change, and visualise progress over time.,\nCategory: Body,\nSubcategory: Health Monitoring,\nSignificance: Consistency is key to establishing long-term healthy habits and achieving desired health outcomes. Tracking streaks can be motivating and reinforce positive behaviour.,\nGame Use: Players can earn points for each day they maintain their streak, with bonuses for reaching milestones (e.g., 7-day, 30-day, or 90-day streaks). Streak progress can be visually displayed in the game, fostering a sense of accomplishment.,\nUnit of Measure: Days,\nHow to Measure: 1. Define Healthy Habits: Collaborate with the health coach to identify a set of 3-5 specific, measurable, and achievable healthy habits (e.g., eating 5 servings of vegetables daily, exercising for 30 minutes, getting 7-8 hours of sleep). 2. Daily Tracking: Use a habit tracker (app or journal) to record whether each habit was completed each day. 3. Calculate Streak: The streak is calculated as the longest continuous period of days where all selected habits were successfully completed. If a habit is missed on a given day, the streak resets to zero.,\nNormal Values: N/A - Streaks will vary greatly depending on the individual and their chosen habits.,\nReferences: Atomic Habits by James Clear,\nValidated Measure: No - This is a self-reported measure, but can be reliable with consistent tracking.,\nTarget Age Group: Lifespan Hacks (All Age Groups),\nTarget Level: 2 Savvy\nResult Type: Temporal,\nResult Type Subtype: Duration \nAdditional Notes: This straightforward metric promotes consistent healthy behaviour by tracking the longest streak of completed habits. Its simplicity and focus on positive reinforcement make it suitable for all age groups. While self-reported, regular tracking enhances reliability. Users are encouraged to collaborate with health coaches to personalise habit selection and receive guidance throughout the process, maximising the metric\\'s effectiveness for fostering long-term lifestyle changes.\n\nArticle: Profession: Physical Therapist\nFocus Area: Injury Prevention\nCategory: Body\nSubcategory: Fitness\nLevel: 4 Virtuoso\nAge Group: Career Navigators (20-29 years)\n\nThe title of above article can be:\n\"\"\"],\n      generation_config=generation_config,\n      safety_settings=safety_settings,\n  )\n\n  print(responses)\n\n\ngeneration_config = {\n    \"max_output_tokens\": 1024,\n    \"temperature\": 0.2,\n    \"top_p\": 0,\n}\n\nsafety_settings = {\n    generative_models.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: generative_models.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,\n    generative_models.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: generative_models.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,\n    generative_models.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT: generative_models.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,\n    generative_models.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: generative_models.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,\n}\n\ngenerate()\n\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
